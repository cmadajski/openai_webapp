# Django Webapp for OpenAI Utilities
This app is mostly a proof-of-concept project to see how OpenAI services can be 
integrated into a webapp. The goal is to target 3 main use-cases first, then
expand the scope if I feel the desire to do so. The 3 use-cases are:

- Text generation using GPT-3
- Audio-to-text transcription using Whisper
- Image generation using DALL-E

Django will be used to manage both the front-end and back-end services. The UI will
be kept to a minimum since this app is meant to be used as a service for an
existing website.
